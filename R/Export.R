#' Export all results to tables
#'
#' @description
#' Outputs all results to a folder called 'export', and zips them.
#'
#' @param outputFolder          Name of local folder to place results; make sure to use forward slashes
#'                              (/). Do not use a folder on a network drive since this greatly impacts
#'                              performance.
#' @param databaseId            A short string for identifying the database (e.g. 'Synpuf').
#' @param databaseName          The full name of the database.
#' @param databaseDescription   A short description (several sentences) of the database.
#' @param minCellCount          The minimum cell count for fields contains person counts or fractions.
#' @param maxCores              How many parallel cores should be used? If more cores are made
#'                              available this can speed up the analyses.
